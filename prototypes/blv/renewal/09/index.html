        Heart Health and Blood Pressure
Intro
 High blood pressure — or hypertension — is common, but it doesn't have to be complicated.
 Even small steps can make a big difference for your heart, brain, and kidneys.
 
Curative is here to help you keep your numbers in range and connect you to care if you need it.

What best describes you?
I'm managing it well
I have high blood pressure but need better control
I think I might have high blood pressure, but not sure

I'm managing it well
That's great to hear! Staying consistent is key.


If you already track your blood pressure or take medication, you're doing the right things to protect your heart.


Your Care Navigator can still help you:
###
Find a primary care provider or a specialist (like a cardiologist or nephrologist, if needed)
