    <p class="body-lg mb-24">Let's make sure you're up to date on preventive screenings that can help catch health issues early when they're easier to treat. These screenings are covered at $0 under your Curative plan.</p>

    <p class="body-lg mb-24">creening recommendations can vary depending on your personal or family health history, so you may have already completed some outside the usual age range.</p>

    <p class="body-lg mb-16 italic">If you've had a screening in the last year, please update your record below.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">A Pap test or HPV test checks for changes in cervical cells that could lead to cancer. These screenings are usually done by a primary care provider or OB/GYN during a routine visit</p>
        
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Depending on your results, your provider may recommend testing every 3 to 5 years or more often if you have a higher risk or family history.</p>
        
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Early detection can prevent most cervical cancers before they start.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-16">Breast Cancer Screening (Ages 40-74, Women)</h3>
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">A mammogram is an X-ray that takes detailed images of breast tissue to look for early signs of cancer — often before anything can be felt</p>
        
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">It's ordered by your primary care provider or OB/GYN and done at a mammography center or imaging facility.</p>
        
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Most women benefit from screening every 1-2 years, but your provider may recommend starting earlier or screening more often if you have a family history or genetic risk factors.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">If your results show dense breast tissue, your provider may order a follow-up test like an ultrasound or MRI — this is common and helps get a clearer picture.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">It also helps to stay familiar with how your breasts normally look and feel. If you notice any new lumps, skin changes, or discharge between screenings, let your provider know right away.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">Regular mammograms and awareness of your own body work together to support early detection, when treatment is more effective.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-16">Colon Cancer Screening (Ages 45-75, Men & Women)</h3>
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Colorectal screenings look for early signs of cancer or precancerous growths in the colon and rectum. They can be done through a colonoscopy — a simple procedure where a gastroenterologist uses a small camera to look inside your colon while you're asleep or relaxed at a medical center — or a stool-based test (like Cologuard), which you can do at home and mail to a lab.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Your primary care provider can help you choose the best option and order the test.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Most people start screening at age 45 and repeat it every year (for stool-based tests) or every 10 years (for colonoscopy).</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">If you have a family history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or a genetic condition like Lynch syndrome, you may need to start earlier or test more often.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">Curative Primary Care offers the Cologuard test for convenient, at-home screening.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-16">Lung Cancer Screening (Ages 50-80, Men & Women)</h3>
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">A low-dose CT scan is a quick imaging test that looks for early signs of lung cancer — long before symptoms show up. It's a quick, painless imaging test that uses X-rays to take detailed pictures of your lungs. It's usually ordered by your primary care provider and done at an imaging center.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">This screening is meant for people ages 50-80 who smoke now or used to smoke heavily but quit within the last 15 years. Your provider will help you decide whether you qualify and if screening makes sense for you.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">If you've ever been a long-term smoker, this is an easy way to stay proactive about your health.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-16">Prostate Cancer Screening (Ages 55-69, Men)</h3>
            <p class="body-lg mb-24">A PSA test is a simple blood test that measures the amount of a protein made by the prostate. Higher levels don't always mean cancer, but they can signal the need for further testing.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">This test is usually ordered by your primary care provider or a urologist as part of a conversation about your overall health and risk factors.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">Because the benefits and risks can vary, prostate cancer screening isn't automatic for everyone. It's best to decide together with your provider whether it's right for you especially if any of the below apply:</p>

            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li class="mb-16">Age 55-69</li>

    <div id="skin-cancer-screening" class="card transparent p-24">
        <h3 class="mb-16">Skin Cancer Screening (Ages 20+, Men & Women)</h3>
A skin exam is a simple visual check of your skin for new or changing moles, freckles, or spots. It can be done by your primary care provider during a routine visit or by a dermatologist if you'd like a more detailed check.

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">During the exam, your provider will look closely at areas that get a lot of sun,  like your face, arms, back, and legs. They may use a small light or a magnifier to get a clearer view.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">If you spend a lot of time in the sun, have fair skin, many moles, or a family history of melanoma, your provider may recommend annual skin checks or refer you to a dermatologist.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24">Between visits, you can also do monthly self-checks at home — look for spots that are changing in size, color, or shape.</p>

            <p class="body-lg mb-24 italic">Getting familiar with your own skin helps you notice changes early — when they're easiest to treat.</p>
