    <h1>The Curative Cash Card</h1>

    <p>Your Curative Cash Card makes paying for care simple, predictable, and stress-free—so you can focus on your health, not the bill.</p>
    <p>Whether you're renewing your plan or using the card for the first time, here's a quick refresh on how it works and what's new.</p>
    
    <h2>What's New for 2025</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>A familiar card with a new name.</h3> The Curative Cash Card—formerly the Zero Card—still gives you an easy way to access covered services at $0 out of pocket.</li>
        <li><h3>Expanded network flexibility.</h3> Use your card at any provider listed in the Curative directory for eligible services, or nominate a new provider to be reviewed for Cash Card use.</li>
        <li><h3>Smarter oversight for big-ticket care.</h3> High-cost or complex procedures automatically go through our clinical review to confirm the right site of care and keep your plan affordable.</li>
        <li><h3>More support for mental health.</h3> Many therapists don't take insurance—but with the Cash Card, you can easily pay cash at approved mental-health providers and still enjoy $0 cost when covered.</li>
    </ul>
