        <h1>What to Expect</h1>


        <h2>Keep Your $0 Coverage Active</h2>

        <p>Your Annual Baseline is your yearly check-in to keep your $0 out-of-pocket coverage going strong.</p>
 

    <p>There are two parts to be considered complete:</p>
       

    <h2>1: Curative Refresh </h2>

    <p>Do this now. Takes 10-15 minutes. </p>
    


     <ul>
        <li>A familiar card with a new name. The Curative Cash Card—formerly the Zero Card—still gives you an easy way to access covered services at $0 out of pocket.</li>
        <li>Expanded network flexibility. Use your card at any provider listed in the Curative directory for eligible services, or nominate a new provider to be reviewed for Cash Card use.</li>
        <li>Smarter oversight for big-ticket care. High-cost or complex procedures automatically go through our clinical review to confirm the right site of care and keep your plan affordable.</li>
        <li>More support for mental health. Many therapists don't take insurance—but with the Cash Card, you can easily pay cash at approved mental-health providers and still enjoy $0 cost when covered.</li>
    </ul>


<section id="part-2" class="scrollto">
    <h2>Annual Clinical Check-In</h2>

    <p>Schedule after you finish the Curative Refresh.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Meet with a Curative clinician</li>
        <li>Update labs or screenings</li>
        <li>Discuss your care needs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Complete both within 120 days of your plan renewal date to be considered complete and continue with $0 out-of-pocket costs.</p>

<section id="privacy" class="scrollto">
    <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your answers are completely confidential.</li>
        <li>They won't affect your coverage or rates, and they're never shared with your employer.</li>
        <li>Everything you share is encrypted and HIPAA-secure.</li>
        <li>You can update or change your responses anytime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now let's start Baseline Part 1. Curative Refresh</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your progress saves automatically, so you can step away and return as needed.</li>
    </ul>
